Iâ€™m currently working on a Text Summarization Project, the repo is not public at the moment.<br/>
The app reads news articles, parses them and summarizes them.<br/>
Tying to add some solution involving graphs to the project, this is done aside from the summarization itself, 
to offer some visual insight into the information extracted from the article.<br/> 
The graphs constructed could highlight some information that otherwise would need some careful reading of the text.<br/>

Working on:â€¨	<br/>
 - read multiple articles -> transform into graphs -> combine the graphs -> reduce size of the final graph to gain some insight <br/>
 - also looking into topic modeling (LDA, Bertopic) <br
 - some small optimization using multiprocessing (see https://github.com/marius-florea/Enron-Data-Loading)

Dependency parsing preview:<br/>
 - dependency parsing done on some short text<br/>
 - SVO extraction <br/>
 - rendered with networkx + matplotlib <br/>
